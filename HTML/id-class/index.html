    <div>Id is for unique elements, but class are 1 type to elements. Hence when you need to specify 1 elements we use id and if we need to catagories element in one group then we give them a class.</div>
    <div>A element can have multiple classes but only one id.</div>
    <div>In css class in target by . in front of class name for example if we have a fruit class then we'll go .fruit{} and for id we use # like #apple{}.</div>

    <!-- An element can have either 1 class -->
    <div class="red">It belongs to only red class</div>
    <!-- or multiple classes -->
    <div class="red bg-yellow">This element belong to two classes red and bg-yellow</div>
    <div id="purple">This element have id purple so if any change is made to let's say using css in id purple then it'll affect only this element. </div>
